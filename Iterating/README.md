# Java 8 Examples
## Iterating
* Describe **WHAT** not **HOW**_
* "Code should read like a _story_ not like a _puzzle_"

### Imperative
* External Iteration
* Mutated variable
* **WHAT** is the code doing?
* **HOW MANY** items am I going to have in my list?
* What if I forget to increment **`value`**?

### Declarative
* Internal Iteration
* No `value` variable
* Is it easier to figure out what the code is doing?
* Stops when it satisfies **`limit(100)`**
* The iteration control is in the call to `iterate`.
